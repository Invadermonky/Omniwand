# Incompatible Items
This is a list of known items that are incompatible with the Omniwand. This is primarily due to the mod itself not handling
tag data correctly and clearing all tag information during block or item interactions.

- Ars Magica 2
  - Crystal Wrench - While this item does work, it does something strange with the tag data, resulting in unpredictable behavior.

- Railcraft
  - Signal Block Surveyor - resets tag data on use
  - Signal Tuner - resets tag data on use
