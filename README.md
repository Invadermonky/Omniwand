## About

The **Omniwand** is a mod that adds a single item to the game, the Omniwand. This wand has the capability to store and mimic any wand, rod, wrench, hammer, or other configuration or utility tool.

This wand is intended for use in large magic/tech modpacks where the dozens of configuration and utility tools can leave much to be desired when it comes to inventory space.

* Craft the Omniwand together with any accepted tool to add it to the Omniwand.
* To remove a tool from the Omniwand, transform the wand into the tool you wish to remove and sneak + drop the item.
* Right-clicking with the Omniwand will open an interface, allowing you to select any tool stored within the Omniwand.
* To revert the Omniwand back to it's original form, drop the transformed tool.
* The Omniwand also features a look-transform feature, where looking at a block will convert the wand into the configured tool. Swapping hands will "lock" the wand to that item until it returns to the main hand.

## 1.6.4 Utilities
Due to the limited nature of configuration and item handling in Minecraft 1.6.4, the Omniwand mod comes with a few additions to make configuring the mod easier.

The mod includes a debug mode for finding item names. While this mode is enabled, placing any item into a crafting grid with the Omniwand will output the item's mod name, item name, and item id to the log.

Additionally, Omniwand features in-game configuration reloading. Simply make any changes to the `omniwand.json` configuration file and save. In-game, use the command `/omniwand reload` to reload all Omniwand settings from the config.
